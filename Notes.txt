-- Call GC's demultiplex
- Might need custom code to figure out which de-multiplexing scheme to use
    - GC's original scheme assumes each barcode #i has i N's on the 5' side
    - Our current scheme with the Hiseq antibiotics all have exactly 8 bases for the barcode

- Use bowtie to align reads, keep them in order
